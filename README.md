## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd educational-passport
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## üì± Usage

### Main Dashboard
- View comprehensive student profile with verification score
- Navigate between Academic, Athletic, and Certificates tabs
- Add new academic records with blockchain verification
- Monitor verification status of all records

### Adding Academic Records
1. Navigate to the "Academic" tab
2. Click "Add Academic Record"
3. Fill in the required information:
   - Program Title
   - Degree Type
   - Field of Study
   - Institution
   - Duration
   - Grade/GPA
4. Submit to automatically create blockchain record

### Verification System
1. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/verify](http://localhost:3000/verify)
2. Enter a blockchain hash or transaction ID
3. Click "Verify Record" to see:
   - Record validity status
   - Blockchain integrity
   - Complete record details
   - Student information

## üîß API Endpoints

### Students
- `GET /api/students` - Get all students
- `GET /api/students?studentId=xxx` - Get specific student
- `POST /api/students` - Create new student

### Academic Records
- `GET /api/academic-records` - Get academic records
- `POST /api/academic-records` - Create academic record

### Athletic Records
- `GET /api/athletic-records` - Get athletic records
- `POST /api/athletic-records` - Create athletic record

### Certificates
- `GET /api/certificates` - Get certificates
- `POST /api/certificates` - Create certificate

### Verification
- `GET /api/verify?hash=xxx` - Verify by hash
- `GET /api/verify?tx=xxx` - Verify by transaction
- `POST /api/verify` - Verify record

## üîí Blockchain Integration

### Hash Generation
Each record type has a specific hash generation method:
- **Academic Records**: `createAcademicHash(record)`
- **Athletic Records**: `createAthleticHash(record)`
- **Certificates**: `createCertificateHash(record)`

### Verification Process
1. Calculate hash from record data
2. Compare with stored blockchain hash
3. Verify blockchain integrity
4. Return verification status

### Mining Process
- Proof-of-work system with adjustable difficulty
- Each block contains previous hash for chain integrity
- Nonce calculation for valid hash generation

## üé® UI Components

### Main Components
- `EducationalPassport` - Main dashboard component
- `AcademicRecordForm` - Form for adding academic records
- `RecordVerifier` - Verification interface
- `StatusBadge` - Status indication badges

### Styling
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Consistent color scheme (blue, green, purple)
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Loading states and error handling

## üß™ Testing
